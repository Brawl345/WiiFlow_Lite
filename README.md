# WiiFlow Lite
My mod of the Wii USB Loader WiiFlow

## Description
WiiFlow Lite is a wii homebrew app used to display and launch your games and apps stored on a USB device or SD card plugged into a Wii or Wii U in Wii mode. The games and apps are displayed in cover flow style display.

## Compiling
WiiFlow Lite is currently compiled using DevkitPro PPC r32 and Libogc 1.8.20. I recommend getting Tortoise Git to checkout the WiiFlow Lite repository.

## Installing
Simply download the latest release and extract it to your apps/wiiflow_lite folder on SD or USB HDD. SD is recommended. Your device should be formatted to FAT32.

wfl_as_wiiflow should be extracted to apps/wiiflow folder.

## Booting
To start WiiFlow Lite you will need the Homebrew Channel or a WiiFlow Lite forwarder channel installed on your Wii or vWii system menu.
